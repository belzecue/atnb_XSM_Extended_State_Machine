name="XSM - eXtended State Machine"
description="A personal implementation of StateCharts for Godot. This Extended State Machine provides easy to use timers and animations, simply by creating Nodes in Editor (composition). 
A basic platform example shows (not very well) the true power of xsm and godot!
Easy Node composition system, timers, animations, regions...

With pending States, substates call, an active states list, arguments to a state_change, but also a history of the active states"
